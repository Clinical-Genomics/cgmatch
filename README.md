# cgmatch
Add patient data to a matchmaker exchange node and show patient matching with test queries.

## Purpose
This document describes how to use this app to test two different types of [Matchmaker Exchange](https://www.matchmakerexchange.org) implementations:
* [MME reference server](https://github.com/MatchmakerExchange/reference-server)
* [Matchbox](https://github.com/macarthur-lab/matchbox)

Evantually this repo will serve as a bridge to export patient data from [Scout](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/scout) database to a Matchmaker instance at Clinical Genomics.

## Requirements
A running instance of both [MME reference server](https://github.com/MatchmakerExchange/reference-server) server and [Matchbox](https://github.com/macarthur-lab/matchbox).
